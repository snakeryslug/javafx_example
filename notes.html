Richard Bair recently posted the results of his experiments with FXML Dependency Injection using Guice. I’m a big fan of Guice but Spring is the most popular
application development framework for enterprise Java (that’s what their website says anyway), mainly because it offers much more than just a DI framework, with
support for databases, transactions, remoting, security and much more.

As such, I’m intending for this post to be the first in a series, called Building JEE applications in JavaFX 2.0, where I’m going to explore various options for doing
just that. This is new territory for everyone, so I welcome all feedback and comments that can help us refine the ‘best practices’ in this ares.

In this first post I’m just going to do a direct port of Richard’s FXML+Guice example into Spring. A lot of people still think Spring is all about XML configuration
files, but it has evolved a lot since those early days. I’m going to use Spring’s annotation based configuration to create a pure Java example (i.e. zero Spring XML)
that looks almost identical to the Guice one.

For those that want to skip the details and get straight to the code, you can find it here: http://code.google.com/p/jfxee/source/browse/trunk/jfxspring/

Note that this is a Maven project – I’m not going to go into detail on this in this post (I will later though), but it is a very simple project structure. If you’ve not used
Maven before you can add your own ant scripts to the project or work out how to use Maven (both Eclipse and IntelliJ can open the pom.xml for you and just
work). 

Step 1: create a Person bean:

This is pretty much the same as Richard’s



public class Person
{
    private String firstName;

    public Person(String firstName)
    {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getFirstName()
    {
        return firstName;
    }
}


Step 2: create a SampleController

This is similar to Richard’s however instead of using Guice’s @Inject annotation, we use Spring’s @Autowire one (I’ve annotated the parameter but you could use
constructor injection if you want):


import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

public class SampleController
{
    @Autowired
    private Person person;

    public Person getPerson()
    {
        return person;
    }

    public void print()
    {
        System.out.println("Well done, " + person.getFirstName() + "!");
    }
}


Step 3: create the FXML file

This is identical to Richard’s, except I used the getPerson().getFirstName() instead of a getPersonName() – Richard could have done the same, no real difference
on this.


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<?language javascript?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.*?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.*?>

<StackPane fx:id="root" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml">
    <children>
        <Button fx:id="printBtn" onAction="controller.print()" />
        <fx:script>printBtn.text = 'Click Me ' + controller.getPerson().getFirstName() + '!';</fx:script>
    </children>
</StackPane>


Step 4: Create a Spring Application Context

Here’s where things start to get interesting. Instead of the Guice ‘Module’ we need to define a Spring equivalent. In this case I have defined a class called
SampleAppFactory (but you can call it anything) – the important bit is that it is annotated with Spring’s @Configuration. Each of the methods that are then
annotated with @Bean belong to the context and Spring can do magic wiring for us. In our case the SampleController will get wired up with the Person because
of the @Autowired annotation on it.

For anyone used to Spring XML, this class is pretty much a direct replacement of the XML configuration file:


import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class SampleAppFactory
{
    @Bean
    public Person person()
    {
        return new Person("Richard");
    }

    @Bean
    public SampleController sampleController()
    {
        return new SampleController();
    }
}


Step 5: Build a custom FXML loader

We can easily build the Spring equivalent of Richard’s GuiceFXMLLoader. It just needs to load the controller from the application context instead of the Guice
Injector. In my next post I’m going to look at how we can simplify this and clean things up a little.


import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class SpringFxmlLoader
{
    private ApplicationContext context;

    public SpringFxmlLoader(ApplicationContext context)
    {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public Object load(String url, Class<?> controllerClass) throws IOException
    {
        InputStream fxmlStream = null;
        try
        {
            fxmlStream = controllerClass.getResourceAsStream(url);
            Object instance = context.getBean(controllerClass);
            FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader();
            loader.getNamespace().put("controller", instance);
            return loader.load(fxmlStream);
        }
        finally
        {
            if (fxmlStream != null)
            {
                fxmlStream.close();
            }
        }
    }
}


Step 6: Create an ‘Application’ to launch it all

This is quite similar to the Guice approach, except we load our application context instead of the Guice injector:


import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Parent;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

public class SampleApp extends Application
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        launch(args);
    }

    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception
    {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context
                = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SampleAppFactory.class);
        SpringFxmlLoader loader = new SpringFxmlLoader(context);

        Parent root = (Parent) loader.load("/sample.fxml", SampleController.class);
        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 320, 240);
        scene.getStylesheets().add("/fxmlapp.css");
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.setTitle("JFX2.0 Sprung");
        stage.show();
    }
}


That’s it! As you can see the code is extremely similar to Guice so the choice between Guice and Spring should depend on the other features offered by each and
how these may benefit you. I’m going to stick with Spring for this series, but a lot of what I go through could easily be adapted back to Guice.

 Very cool. One thing though, in the SpringFxmlLoader you need to explicitly close the input stream. It is a royal pain in the neck, but there you have it 
:-)

 I have been trying to get you projects going using Maven, but having no luck. Updated pom.xml, to point javafx to the program files/oracle …..

 I have all of the projects at http://code.google.com/p/jfxee/source/browse/trunk/ building correctly with no errors.

 But as soon as I go to run the application in any project, I always get the following
 Executing command line: “C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_26\bin\java.exe” -classpath
 C:\Users\Mac\Documents\NetBeansProjects\trunk\jfxee5\target\classes;C:\Users\Mac\.m2\repository\org\springframework\spring-context\3.0.6.RELEASE\spring-context-3.0.6.RELEASE.jar;C:\Users\Mac\.m2\repository\org\springframework\spring-aop\3.0.6.RELEASE\spring-aop-3.0.6.RELEASE.jar;C:\Users\Mac\.m2\repository\org\springframework\spring-beans\3.0.6.RELEASE\spring-beans-3.0.6.RELEASE.jar;C:\Users\Mac\.m2\repository\org\springframework\spring-core\3.0.6.RELEASE\spring-core-3.0.6.RELEASE.jar;C:\Users\Mac\.m2\repository\commons-logging\commons-logging\1.1.1\commons-logging-1.1.1.jar;C:\Users\Mac\.m2\repository\org\springframework\spring-expression\3.0.6.RELEASE\spring-expression-3.0.6.RELEASE.jar;C:\Users\Mac\.m2\repository\org\springframework\spring-asm\3.0.6.RELEASE\spring-asm-3.0.6.RELEASE.jar;C:\Users\Mac\.m2\repository\cglib\cglib\2.2\cglib-2.2.jar;C:\Users\Mac\.m2\repository\asm\asm\3.1\asm-3.1.jar

 Any ideas why Maven is not finding the jfxruntime when trying to run??

 It looks like the jfxrt.jar is not being added to your runtime classpath. If you are compiling correctly then it must be adding it to the compile classpath so this is
 a little strange.

 Due to complexities with Maven and native files we currently have to use the system (I’m trying to find ways around this). My guess is that NetBeans isn’t
 handling this system scope properly and is leaving out the JFX runtime jar (system scope is not used often so it’s possible NetBeans doesn’t support it that
 well). I don’t use NetBeans myself but IntelliJ definitely works with this setup. I do have a copy of NetBeans on my work computer so I will give it a whirl
 tomorrow and get back to you.

 Short term fix would be to manually add the jfxrt.jar (found in your-jfx-home/rt/lib) to your classpath using NetBeans’ standard classpath system. Make sure
 you leave the jar in the place where it was installed and just reference it there, don’t move it or the dll’s won’t load.

 I have used NetBeans 7.1 to open the project with maven.
 I have just edited the pom.xml to look for a jfxrt.jar that I had previously installed in my local repository with the next command:

 mvn install:install-file -Dfile=”C:\Program Files\Oracle\JavaFX 2.0 SDK\rt\lib\jfxrt.jar” -DgroupId=com.oracle.javafx -DartifactId=javafx -Dversion=2.0.2
 -Dpackaging=jar

 The project doesn’t show errors or warnings and was built succesfully… But NetBeans has created the project with just the three dependencies described in
 the pom.xml and a “project files” folder with the pom.xml inside. ¿ Isn’t maven supposed to create a java app. architecture ? I mean the folder structure like
 src/main/java and src/main/test ¿ Or I should create that things ?

 Thank you !!

 Maven can create those directories for you (or Netbeans probably will to, but I don’t use it so can’t say for sure). You have to use one of the templates for this
 though. Maven calls these archetypes: http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html

 I usually don’t bother however and I just add the src/main/java directory and the like manually. In IntelliJ (and I’m pretty sure Eclipse) it will automatically pick
 up these directories once they have been created manually and you can start using them.

 Just a word of caution, by installing the jar file in the repo, your code will compile (since the jar is available) but JFX won’t be able to find the dll’s when it is run
 (these are kept outside of the jar). I’m planning to do a post on this shortly.

 Woh, that went faster than expected… Your reply helped me very much to understand some things… gave me some clues. I’ve been reading that theres a
 plugin for eclipse called m2eclipse that lets you do something like that “mvn eclipse:eclipse” in order to import the project to the IDE with a given pom.xml
 maybe this feature is there also for NetBeans. If not i suppose I should first create a project (an artifact) with the groupId=com.zenjava, package=jfxspring
 and an archetype i.e. maven-archetype-quickstart in order to match the same folder structure in the project of your google prj. repository
 src/main/java/com/zenjava/jfxspring and then edit the pom.xml dependencies manually…

 Ahm, nice advice about the jfxrt.jar, i’ll return then to the system scope… And I’ll be impatient for your next post 
;-) 

 Thank you very much !

 In step 5:
 “We can easily build the Swing equivalent of Richard’s GuiceFXMLLoader. ”

 I think it’s supposed to be Spring instead of Swing.
 Am i right?

 Yes, ‘Spring’ not ‘Swing’ – good catch. I’ve fixed the post. Thanks!

 I think

 scene.getStylesheets().add(“/fxmlapp.css”);

 should be
 scene.getStylesheets().add(“fxmlapp.css”);

 fxmlapp.css with out the “/” . Had to make this to get it to work.

 You could improve your way to load the fxml using: FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(s)); instead get it as stream. Or is it a bad practice?

 nice way to inject your controller in SprinFxmlLoader but it doesn’t seem to work for me:
 I get following error:
 javafx.fxml.LoadException: No controller specified.

 anyone got a suggestion?
